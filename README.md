# Shortly After
A one stop shop for everyday people to share and keep track of recommendations and wishlists.

## What is in Shortly After?
Yes, you guessed it right "Bucket List App". But wait, who and why would someone use this application ?
I personally have got a lot of recommendations from friends, family and colleagues at various discussions and occasions. I wanted to always have a easy to store and try it out later kind of list. You probably might be wondering I can create a checklist in my notes apps or even a physical sticky notes.

But, I always felt we should have a flexibility to easily search, add, share some of the best things I loved and others like as well.
So, the purpose of this application is to enable users to add their wishlist / bucket list items into one easily accessible application.

## Hungry for more info ?
Any recommendation or wishlist item can be categorized into 5 major categories listed below.
- Books
- Music / Podcast
- Movies / TV
- Bookmarks
- Places
	- Restaurants
	- Bars
	- Locations
	- Countries / Cities

## How are we building ?
The plan is to use [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) for the front-end and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to aggregate our service calls and sync with the front-end.
